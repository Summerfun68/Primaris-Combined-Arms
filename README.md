This sub-mod started because I was trying to better understand why the damn turret was disrespecting me and crashing my game with a simple edit.
Now the mod adds two new paths.
Emperor's Blessing locks you out of the chaos route but provides you with mainly more craft to play with from the IG and a few special goodies in terms of units/armors.
Questionable Service path will convert you to the cult of theron, wich will lock you out of most of this submod (not all)
The player still has the choice to do neither and do a regular routes with additional craft.
The chaos truck was given a boost and so was the hyper-turret. Since they were extremely lacking.
I will make another route in the future.
